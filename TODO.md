# Caveat Emptor
I admit, I've not dug into any sort of detail, but here's what I'm thinking at this point.

I would like to take this codebase and do the following:

1. Dockerize it. See if I can get it running under a container.
2. Convert it to `aws sam` and use the following AWS services:
    - APIGateway
    - Lambda
    - Cloudfront, maybe?

Again, I would just like to point out I haven't done much research and it's late on Friday night but based on my experiences both should be quite doable.
